These *solutions* have no verification other than me, a self taught student.
It may be wrong, so if you find any error, please let me know!
Other than that, have fun reading the solutions of some of the exercises in Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis.

# 4. 

## Part (a)

Prove the following statements.
If $E_1 \subset V_1$ and $E_2 \subset V_2$, where $V_1$ and $V_2$ are disjoint open sets, then $\mu(E_1 \cup E_2) = \mu(E_1) + \mu(E_2)$, even if $E_1$ and $E_2$ are not in $\mathfrak{M}$.

*Proof*. By step 1 in the proof of Riesz's theorem,

$$\mu(E_1 \cup E_2) \leq \mu(E_1) + \mu(E_2)$$

We try to prove the opposite inequality to prove the equality.
Since the measure of a set $E$ is defined as the infimum of measures of open sets containing $E$, we can get an open set $V$ containing $E_1 \cup E_2$ satisfying

$$\mu(E_1 \cup E_2) + \varepsilon \geq \mu(V)$$

We then use the following inequality

$$\mu(V) \geq \mu(V_1 \cap V) + \mu(V_2 \cap V)$$

This holds because $\mu$ is a measure and $V_1 \cap V_2 = \emptyset$.
And since $V_i \cap V$ contains $E_i$, we can use the two inequality to show that

$$\mu(E_1 \cup E_2) + \varepsilon \geq \mu(E_1) + \mu(E_2)$$

Since this inequality holds for all $\varepsilon$, the desired inequality and equality follows.

## Part (b)

Given a set $E \in \mathfrak{M}_F$, decompose it into a disjoint countable collection of compact sets and a set with measure 0. 
In other words, show that there exists $N$ and $K_i$ where $\mu(N) = 0$ and $\{K_i \}$ is a disjoint countable collection of compact sets such that

$$E = N \cup K_1 \cup K_2 \cup \cdots$$


*Proof*. Since a set of $\mathfrak{M}_F$ can be approximated from the inside by compact sets, choose $K_1$ such that $\mu(K) \geq 1/2 \times \mu(E)$
Since compact sets are in $\mathfrak{M}_F$ and since $\mathfrak{M}_F$ is closed under set operations, $E - K_1$ is also in $\mathfrak{M}_F$. 
We repeat this process by setting 
$K_n$ for $$E - (\bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1} K_i)$$.

The sets $\{ K_i \}$ are disjoint since
$K_n \subset E - (\bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1} K_i)$.

The set $E - (\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty K_i)$ has measure 0 because $\mu(E) < \infty$.
Set it as $N$ which then completes the proof.
